# angular-app

This folder contains a full, minimal Angular (modern) application scaffold. It's intended for training and local experimentation.

Quick start:

1. From the `angular-app` folder, install dependencies:

```bash
cd angular-app
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The dev server uses the local `@angular/cli` and `@angular-devkit/build-angular` dependencies.

Files of interest:
- `src/app/game/` — the `GameComponent` and styles
- `src/app/game.service.ts` — API wrapper for deckofcards

If you prefer I can also generate this app at the repo root or customize TypeScript/angular versions.
